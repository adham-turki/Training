## General/Conceptual Questions

### What is the role of a frontend developer?
**Answer**: A frontend developer builds and maintains the user interface of websites or web applications using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. They ensure responsive, interactive, and visually appealing interfaces, collaborating with designers and backend developers to integrate APIs and deliver a seamless user experience.

**Why Asked**: To assess your understanding of the role and its responsibilities.

### What is the difference between HTML, CSS, and JavaScript?
**Answer**:
- **HTML**: Defines the structure and content (e.g., headings, paragraphs).
- **CSS**: Controls presentation and styling (e.g., colors, layouts).
- **JavaScript**: Adds interactivity and dynamic behavior (e.g., form validation, API calls).
**Example**: HTML creates a button, CSS styles it, JavaScript makes it clickable.

**Why Asked**: Tests foundational knowledge of core frontend technologies.

### What is semantic HTML vs. non-semantic HTML?
**Answer**:
- **Semantic HTML**: Uses tags that describe content meaning (e.g., `<header>`, `<article>`). Improves accessibility and SEO.
- **Non-semantic HTML**: Uses generic tags (e.g., `<div>`, `<span>`).
**Example**: `<nav>` (semantic) vs. `<div class="nav">` (non-semantic).

**Why Asked**: Checks knowledge of modern HTML practices.

## HTML Questions

### What is the DOCTYPE declaration?
**Answer**: `<!DOCTYPE html>` at the top of an HTML file indicates it’s an HTML5 document, ensuring browsers render in standards mode to avoid quirks.

**Why Asked**: Tests basic HTML knowledge.

### What are HTML5 features?
**Answer**:
- Semantic tags: `<section>`, `<article>`, `<aside>`.
- Multimedia: `<video>`, `<audio>`.
- Form enhancements: `type="email"`, `placeholder`.
- APIs: Geolocation, Canvas, Web Storage.

**Why Asked**: Assesses awareness of modern HTML capabilities.

### How do you make an image accessible?
**Answer**: Use the `alt` attribute with descriptive text. Example: `<img src="cat.jpg" alt="A fluffy white cat sitting on a couch">`. For decorative images, use `alt=""`.

**Why Asked**: Tests accessibility best practices.

### What is the HTML skeleton?
**Answer**:
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
  <title>My Page</title>
</head>
<body>
  <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
</body>
</html>
```

**Why Asked**: Verifies understanding of basic HTML structure.

## CSS Questions

### What are the different ways to apply CSS?
**Answer**:
- **Inline CSS**: Using the `style` attribute (e.g., `<p style="color: blue;">Text</p>`).
- **Internal CSS**: Inside a `<style>` tag in `<head>`.
- **External CSS**: Linking a `.css` file with `<link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">`.
**Preferred**: External CSS for maintainability.

**Why Asked**: Tests knowledge of CSS application methods.

### What is the CSS box model?
**Answer**: The box model describes an element’s rectangular structure:
- **Content**: Text or images.
- **Padding**: Space between content and border.
- **Border**: Surrounds padding.
- **Margin**: Space outside the border.
**Note**: Total width = content + padding + border + margin. Use `box-sizing: border-box` to include padding and border in width.

**Why Asked**: Tests core CSS layout knowledge.

### What is Flexbox, and how does it work?
**Answer**: Flexbox is a CSS layout module for flexible, responsive layouts. A flex container (`display: flex`) controls its children (flex items) using:
- `justify-content`: Aligns items along the main axis (e.g., `space-between`).
- `align-items`: Aligns items along the cross axis (e.g., `center`).
- `flex-direction`: Sets the main axis (`row` or `column`).
**Example**:
```css
.container {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
}
```

**Why Asked**: Flexbox is widely used for modern layouts.

### What is the difference between relative, absolute, and fixed positioning?
**Answer**:
- **relative**: Positioned relative to its normal position; offsets (`top`, `left`) shift it but reserve space.
- **absolute**: Positioned relative to the nearest positioned ancestor or `<body>`; removed from normal flow.
- **fixed**: Positioned relative to the viewport; stays in place during scrolling.
- **sticky**: Toggles between `relative` and `fixed` based on scroll position.

**Why Asked**: Tests understanding of CSS positioning.

### How do you make a website responsive?
**Answer**:
- Use relative units (`vw`, `vh`, `rem`, `em`, `%`).
- Apply media queries (e.g., `@media (max-width: 600px) { ... }`).
- Use flexible layouts (Flexbox, Grid).
- Ensure responsive images (e.g., `max-width: 100%` or `<picture>`).

**Why Asked**: Responsive design is critical for modern web development.

## JavaScript Questions

### What is JavaScript, and what can it do?
**Answer**: JavaScript is a programming language that adds interactivity to websites. It can:
- Manipulate the DOM (e.g., change HTML/CSS).
- Handle events (e.g., clicks, form submissions).
- Fetch data from APIs using `fetch`.
- Create animations or validate forms.

**Why Asked**: Ensures understanding of JavaScript’s role.

### What is the difference between `var`, `let`, and `const`?
**Answer**:
- **var**: Function-scoped, hoisted, can be redeclared/reassigned.
- **let**: Block-scoped, can be reassigned, not redeclared in same scope.
- **const**: Block-scoped, cannot be reassigned/redeclared (object properties can be modified).
**Example**:
```javascript
let x = 10; x = 20; // Works
const y = 10; y = 20; // Error
```

**Why Asked**: Tests ES6+ scoping knowledge.

### What is hoisting?
**Answer**: JavaScript moves variable and function declarations to the top of their scope during compilation. Only declarations are hoisted, not initializations.
**Example**:
```javascript
console.log(x); // undefined
var x = 5;
```

**Why Asked**: Tests understanding of execution context.

### What is the DOM, and how do you interact with it?
**Answer**: The DOM (Document Object Model) is a tree-like representation of HTML. JavaScript interacts via:
- **Select**: `document.querySelector('.class')`.
- **Modify**: `element.textContent = 'New text';`.
- **Add**: `document.createElement('div')` and `parent.appendChild(div)`.
**Example**:
```javascript
const para = document.createElement('p');
para.textContent = 'Hello, DOM!';
document.body.appendChild(para);
```

**Why Asked**: Tests core JavaScript skills for frontend.

### What are events, and how do you handle them?
**Answer**: Events are actions (e.g., click, keypress) handled by event listeners.
**Example**:
```javascript
document.querySelector('#myButton').addEventListener('click', () => {
  alert('Button clicked!');
});
```

**Why Asked**: Tests interactivity knowledge.

### What is event delegation?
**Answer**: Attaching a single event listener to a parent element to handle events for its children, leveraging event bubbling.
**Example**:
```javascript
document.getElementById('list').addEventListener('click', (e) => {
  if (e.target.tagName === 'LI') {
    console.log(e.target.textContent);
  }
});
```

**Why Asked**: Tests efficient event handling.

### What are closures?
**Answer**: A closure is a function that retains access to its outer scope’s variables.
**Example**:
```javascript
function outer() {
  let count = 0;
  return function inner() {
    count++;
    console.log(count);
  };
}
const counter = outer();
counter(); // 1
counter(); // 2
```

**Why Asked**: Tests scope and function behavior.

### What is the difference between `==` and `===`?
**Answer**:
- `==`: Loose equality, coerces types (e.g., `5 == '5'` is `true`).
- `===`: Strict equality, no coercion (e.g., `5 === '5'` is `false`).

**Why Asked**: Tests type coercion knowledge.

### What are arrow functions?
**Answer**: Arrow functions (`=>`) are concise ES6 functions that inherit `this` from their lexical scope.
**Example**:
```javascript
const add = (a, b) => a + b;
```

**Why Asked**: Tests ES6 syntax and `this` behavior.

### What is asynchronous JavaScript, and how do you handle it?
**Answer**: Asynchronous JavaScript allows non-blocking operations (e.g., API calls). Handled via:
- **Callbacks**: Functions executed after a task.
- **Promises**: Objects with `.then` and `.catch`.
- **Async/Await**: Syntactic sugar for promises.
**Example (Async/Await)**:
```javascript
async function fetchData() {
  try {
    const response = await fetch('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/1');
    const data = await response.json();
    console.log(data);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error:', error);
  }
}
```

**Why Asked**: Tests modern async programming.

### What is the `this` keyword?
**Answer**: `this` refers to the context of a function call (e.g., the calling object in a method).
**Example**:
```javascript
const obj = {
  name: 'Test',
  getName: function() { return this.name; }
};
console.log(obj.getName()); // 'Test'
```

**Why Asked**: Tests context understanding.

## React Questions

### What is React, and why is it used?
**Answer**: React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces using:
- **Components**: Reusable UI blocks.
- **Virtual DOM**: Efficient updates.
- **One-way data flow**: Predictable state.

**Why Asked**: Tests familiarity with React.

### What are components in React?
**Answer**: Components are reusable UI blocks, either:
- **Functional**: Using functions and hooks (e.g., `useState`).
- **Class-based**: Using classes and state.
**Example**:
```jsx
const Button = () => <button>Click</button>;
```

**Why Asked**: Tests core React concepts.

### What is state management in React?
**Answer**:
- **Local state**: Managed with `useState` hook.
- **Global state**: Managed with Redux or Context API.
**Example (Local State)**:
```jsx
import { useState } from 'react';
const Counter = () => {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  return <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>{count}</button>;
};
```

**Why Asked**: Tests understanding of React data management.

### What is JSX?
**Answer**: JSX is a syntax extension for JavaScript that allows HTML-like code in JavaScript, compiled to `React.createElement()`.
**Example**:
```jsx
const element = <h1>Hello, JSX!</h1>;
```

**Why Asked**: Tests React syntax knowledge.

## REST and Statelessness

### What is statelessness in REST?
**Answer**: Statelessness means each client request contains all necessary information, and the server doesn’t store session data. This improves:
- **Scalability**: Servers handle requests independently.
- **Reliability**: Fault-tolerant, as any server can process a request.
**Example**:
```http
POST /api/cart/add
Authorization: Bearer <token>
Content-Type: application/json
{
  "userId": "123",
  "productId": "567",
  "quantity": 2
}
```

**Why Asked**: Tests understanding of REST principles.

### What is fault-tolerance?
**Answer**: Fault-tolerance is a system’s ability to continue operating despite failures. In REST, statelessness enables fault-tolerance by allowing any server to handle requests without prior context.
**Example**: If one server crashes, a load balancer redirects the request to another server.

**Why Asked**: Tests knowledge of system reliability.

## Behavioral/Soft Skills Questions

### Tell me about a project you’ve worked on.
**Answer**: Use the STAR method (Situation, Task, Action, Result):
- **Example**: “I built a to-do list app using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. My role was to design the UI and implement features like adding and deleting tasks. I used localStorage to persist data, overcoming challenges with data retrieval by researching MDN documentation.”

**Why Asked**: Assesses experience and communication.

### How do you handle a bug in your code?
**Answer**:
1. Reproduce the bug to identify its cause.
2. Debug using browser dev tools or `console.log`.
3. Research solutions (e.g., MDN, Stack Overflow).
4. Fix and test across cases.
5. Refactor to prevent future issues.

**Why Asked**: Tests problem-solving skills.

### How do you stay updated with frontend trends?
**Answer**: Follow blogs (CSS-Tricks, MDN), X communities, YouTube (freeCodeCamp), and experiment with side projects.

**Why Asked**: Shows passion and learning ability.
